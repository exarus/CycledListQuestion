# Interview Question: Is it a cycled list

## Question

Write an algorithm that checks if the the following structure is a cycled list?
A structure is composed of nodes with 2 properties: id, id of the next node.
If id of the next node is null then the node is the last one.

## Solution

My first idea had complexity of O(nÂ²). The repository contains the code.

## The story

The code is a solution to a question asked on my first inteview ever (2014).
